    <h1>polarity — Detect the polarity (sentiment) of text</h1>
    <p>A quick demo of <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/polarity/">wooorm/polarity</a>.</p>
    <p>Just paste (or write) some text in the text area below. I recommend Googling <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Awww.imdb.com+%22reviews+%26+ratings%22">IMDb for reviews</a>.</p>
    <p>Please raise any issues on <a href="https://github.com/wooorm/polarity/issues">GitHub</a>.</p>
    <p>The positivity or negativity on paragraphs and sentences is depicted by their background colour. The polarity of words is depicted through a coloured underline. Pure red or green underlines depict maximum polarity; the more blue in the underline, the less extreme the “emotions”.</p>
